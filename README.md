# transforming-data
For this project I was tasked to search for a publicaly avaliable data set and pyse pyspark for the ETL process. I was also tasked on how I would ingest, transform and output the data. I used spark.sql to view columns that I wanted to see and then extracted and transformed the dataset into more manageable piecies inorder to get specific data out of it

### Tools that I used for this project
